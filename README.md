# OnlineShop
Developed a Maven online shopping web application with Spring framework, allowing individual users to view all products, add/remove/view products in the shopping cart, check out, and see delivered ads and particularly allowing the admin user to add/edit/delete certain products; specifically utilized Spring MVC to decouple the logic of the entire project with IoC, built frontend pages with JSP and JavaScript in the “View” layer, facilitated ORM-based database (including tables of cart, product, user etc.) operations and business logic with JPA specifications and Hibernate in the “Model” layer, handled client requests and navigation logic in the “Controller” layer, supported user/admin jdbc authentication workflow by Spring Security, used Spring Web Flow for enabling the “customer details -> shipping address ->receipt” checkout process(XML-based configuration), and integrated it with an ads-posting app and implemented Google’s bidding algorithm to feature the ad with best rank; note that Spring Web Flow used XML-based configuration, Spring Security/Hibernate Java-based configuration while Spring MVC both XML and annotation-based configuration.
